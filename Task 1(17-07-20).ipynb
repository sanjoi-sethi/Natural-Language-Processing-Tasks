      "On each national day of inauguration since 1789 , the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the United States . In Washington ' s day the task of the people was to create and weld together a nation . In Lincoln ' s day the task of the people was to preserve that Nation from disruption from within . In this day the task of the people is to save that Nation and its institutions from disruption from without . To us there has come a time , in the midst of swift happenings , to pause for a moment and take stock -- to recall what our place in history has been , and to rediscover what we are and what we may be . If we do not , we risk the real peril of inaction . Lives of nations are determined not by the count of years , but by the lifetime of the human spirit . The life of a man is three - score years and ten : a little more , a little less . The life of a nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live . There are men who doubt this . There are men who believe that democracy , as a form of Government and a frame of life , is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that , for some unexplained reason , tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future -- and that freedom is an ebbing tide . But we Americans know that this is not true . Eight years ago , when the life of this Republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror , we proved that this is not true . We were in the midst of shock -- but we acted . We acted quickly , boldly , decisively . These later years have been living years -- fruitful years for the people of this democracy . For they have brought to us greater security and , I hope , a better understanding that life ' s ideals are to be measured in other than material things . Most vital to our present and our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home ; put away many evil things ; built new structures on enduring lines ; and , through it all , maintained the fact of its democracy . For action has been taken within the three - way framework of the Constitution of the United States . The coordinate branches of the Government continue freely to function . The Bill of Rights remains inviolate . The freedom of elections is wholly maintained . Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught . Democracy is not dying . We know it because we have seen it revive -- and grow . We know it cannot die -- because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise -- an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority . We know it because democracy alone , of all forms of government , enlists the full force of men ' s enlightened will . We know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life . We know it because , if we look below the surface , we sense it still spreading on every continent -- for it is the most humane , the most advanced , and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society . A nation , like a person , has a body -- a body that must be fed and clothed and housed , invigorated and rested , in a manner that measures up to the objectives of our time . A nation , like a person , has a mind -- a mind that must be kept informed and alert , that must know itself , that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors -- all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world . And a nation , like a person , has something deeper , something more permanent , something larger than the sum of all its parts . It is that something which matters most to its future -- which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present . It is a thing for which we find it difficult -- even impossible -- to hit upon a single , simple word . And yet we all understand what it is -- the spirit -- the faith of America . It is the product of centuries . It was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands -- some of high degree , but mostly plain people , who sought here , early and late , to find freedom more freely . The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history . It is human history . It permeated the ancient life of early peoples . It blazed anew in the middle ages . It was written in Magna Charta . In the Americas its impact has been irresistible . America has been the New World in all tongues , to all peoples , not because this continent was a new - found land , but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life -- a life that should be new in freedom . Its vitality was written into our own Mayflower Compact , into the Declaration of Independence , into the Constitution of the United States , into the Gettysburg Address . Those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit , and the millions who followed , and the stock that sprang from them -- all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation . The hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self - serving wealth . We know that we still have far to go ; that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen , in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land . But it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone . It is not enough to clothe and feed the body of this Nation , and instruct and inform its mind . For there is also the spirit . And of the three , the greatest is the spirit . Without the body and the mind , as all men know , the Nation could not live . But if the spirit of America were killed , even though the Nation ' s body and mind , constricted in an alien world , lived on , the America we know would have perished . That spirit -- that faith -- speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often unnoticed , because they seem so obvious . It speaks to us here in the Capital of the Nation . It speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 States . It speaks to us in our counties , in our cities , in our towns , and in our villages . It speaks to us from the other nations of the hemisphere , and from those across the seas -- the enslaved , as well as the free . Sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom is such an old , old story . The destiny of America was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first President in his first inaugural in 1789 -- words almost directed , it would seem , to this year of 1941 : \" The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply , finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people .\" If we lose that sacred fire -- if we let it be smothered with doubt and fear -- then we shall reject the destiny which Washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish . The preservation of the spirit and faith of the Nation does , and will , furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense . In the face of great perils never before encountered , our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy . For this we muster the spirit of America , and the faith of America . We do not retreat . We are not content to stand still . As Americans , we go forward , in the service of our country , by the will of God .\n"
